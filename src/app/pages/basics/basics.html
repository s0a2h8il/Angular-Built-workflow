<h1>Workflow Basics</h1>
<p class="mb-4">Understanding the core terminology is the first step to mastering GitHub Actions.</p>

<div class="card">
    <h3>🔄 Workflow</h3>
    <p>A configurable automated process that will run one or more jobs. Workflows are defined by a YAML file checked in
        to your repository and will run when triggered by an event in your repository, or they can be triggered
        manually, or at a defined schedule.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
    <h3>⚡ Event</h3>
    <p>A specific activity in a repository that triggers a workflow run. For example, activity can originate from GitHub
        when someone creates a pull request, pushes a commit, or opens an issue.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
    <h3>📦 Job</h3>
    <p>A set of steps in a workflow that execute on the same runner. Each step is either a shell script that will be
        executed, or an action that will be run. Steps are executed in order and are dependent on each other. Since each
        step is executed on the same runner, you can share data from one step to another.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
    <h3>🏃 Step</h3>
    <p>An individual task that can run commands or actions. A job contains a sequence of steps.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
    <h3>🎬 Action</h3>
    <p>A custom application for the GitHub Actions platform that performs a complex but frequently repeated task. Use
        actions to help reduce the amount of repetitive code that you write in your workflow files.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
    <h3>💻 Runner</h3>
    <p>A server that runs your workflows when they're triggered. Each runner can run a single job at a time. GitHub
        provides Ubuntu Linux, Microsoft Windows, and macOS runners to run your workflows.</p>
