<h1>Introduction to GitHub Actions</h1>

    <h2>What is GitHub Actions?</h2>
    <p>
        GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate
        your build, test, and deployment pipeline. You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to
        your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.
    </p>
    <p>
        It goes beyond just DevOps and lets you run workflows when other events happen in your repository. For example,
        you can run a workflow to automatically add the appropriate labels whenever someone creates a new issue in your
        repository.

        <li><strong>Matrix Builds:</strong> Save time by testing across multiple operating systems and runtime versions
            simultaneously.</li>
